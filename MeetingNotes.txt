26.06.2025: OMR Project Codebase Shared and Setup (No Transfer of Knowledge)

02.07.2025: Working on OMR from Scratch
            1. Codebase Setup
            2. Anchor Detection Successfull
            3. Referring to Option from Anchor1 Successfull.
            4. Option Detection Successfull (need to work on the output JSON Format)
            Suggestions:
            1. Working on the Test Series OMR Format (Test01 Folder, I was testing on the BE23 Series)
            2. Find a Buffer for Option Detection.
            3. Discussed on approaching the Resgistration Number type columns (Vertical Columns) Row-wise.
            Special Request:
            1. Store the Anchor Centres of the OMR as a CSV

03.07.2025: Working on Extracting Option Marked by Candidate
            1. Option Detection upgraded for False Detections (still a PAINPOINT exists for option_marked !=1)
            2. CSV for Anchor Centres generated
            3. Output JSON Format structured as well as a CSV being generated.
            Suggestions:
            1. Find a Buffer (not yet successfull as the whole sheet has not been annotated yet)
            2. Store the mean intensity for each option (previously stored just the min_mean_intensity i.e. the marked option)
